rock-Spock-paper-lizard-scissors is a hand game played by 2 players. Player1 and Player2 get to choose one of these 5 names each. When they disclose their choice, the player who happened to choose the dominant one of the two choices wins the game. The dominant one in any pair can be determined based on the following set of rules.

scissors cuts paper
paper covers rock
rock crushes lizard
lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes scissors
scissors decapitates lizard
lizard eats paper
paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes rock
rock crushes scissors

So, if Player1 chooses Spock and Player2 chooses paper,  Player2 wins as paper is the dominant one (paper disproves Spock )
