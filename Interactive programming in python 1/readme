# Fundamentals of Computing Specialization assignments
The assignments in the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization offered by Rice University (Coursera platform) are solved and given here. The specialization has 7 courses including 1 Capstone project. Courses and the corresponding mini-projects are organized in different folders here.

## Course1 : Interactive Programming in Python (Part1)
### RPSLS.py
This is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation of the hand game rock-Spock-paper-lizard-scissors usually played by 2 players. Each of the Players get to choose one of these 5 names. When they disclose their choice, the player who happened to choose the dominant one of the two choices wins the game. The dominant one in any pair can be determined based on the following set of rules.

* scissors cuts paper
* scissors decapitates lizard
* paper covers rock
* paper disproves Spock
* rock crushes lizard
* rock crushes scissors
* lizard poisons Spock
* lizard eats paper
* Spock smashes scissors
* Spock vaporizes rock

It is clear that each of the 5 choices wins against two other choices and loses to two other choices. So, if Player1 chooses Spock and Player2 chooses paper,  Player2 wins as paper wins over Spock (paper disproves Spock )
